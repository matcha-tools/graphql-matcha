There are those who love to get dirty and fix things. They drink coffee at dawn, beer after work. And those who stay clean, just appreciate things. At breakfast they have milk and juice at night. There are those who do both, they drink tea.

## Matcha

Matcha is a powerful tool designed to assist the developer by integrating a schema visualizer and generating tests for queries.

### How to Use

- To use Matcha, install and incorporate the express middleware into your existing project with npm. To use the express middleware, simply import the package into your server file and drop your schema in there. 

- Matcha will be available at the specified route. 

- Once installed, navigate to the proper URL to load up our GUI. 

### Features
- Matcha aims to assist the developer during development with GraphQL. By Integrating a visualizer in conjunction with the core functionality of GraphiQL, developers are now able to explore their GraphQL schema while simultaneously testing their queries.   

- Navigate through the panel to the left in the interactive visualizer to auto-generate queries rather than manually typing them in. 

- Auto-generate tests for any or all executed queries

- Copy or export auto-generated tests
